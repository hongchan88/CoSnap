## 📸 Project Overview
CoSnap was born from a simple travel frustration:  
**“Who will take my photo when I’m traveling alone?”**

This project connects travelers visiting the same destination around the same time, allowing them to take photos for each other — and potentially create meaningful new connections along the journey.

It is designed for:
- Solo travelers  
- Couples  
- Families  

The goal is simple:  
**“A small connection that makes everyone’s trip richer.”**

The project is still in progress and may contain bugs 😅  
But the core user flow — finding travelers → sending match offers → creating travel flags — is fully testable.
