  - ✅ Verify profile data integrity before offer creation (app/routes/explore.tsx:141-153)
  - ✅ Ensure proper database relationship between users and profiles
  - ✅ Test offer submission edge cases with proper error handling

### User Experience
- [x] **Improve error feedback**
  - ✅ Prevent multiple submissions on error (isSubmitting state)
  - ✅ Clear error state when form is modified (via useEffect)
  - ✅ Provide actionable error resolution steps via translations
  - ✅ Maintain translation support for error messages

## Files Modified Summary

### New Files Created
